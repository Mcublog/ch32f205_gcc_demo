Demo project

**Note:** Does not work with J-Link.

## Openocd and WCH-LinkE

As far as I know, the main openocd does not support ch32f2x at the moment. But I [found a fork](https://github.com/mengfanyuc/openocd) with support for it.

But it's not all that simpleüòÅ. I'm getting an error when trying to build it. So I fixed it with the code below:

```c
// switch (cortex_m_get_partno_safe(target)) NOTE: replace to
switch (cortex_m_get_impl_part(target))
```

Next I'm replaced binary openocd from [openocd-xpack](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack) to mine.

Added some scripts for Wch-Link to project.

Checkout scripts for vscode in folder .vscode.
